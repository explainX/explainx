### We are looking for co-authors to take this project forward. Reach out @ ms8909@nyu.edu
#### ExplainX is a model explainability/interpretability framework for data scientists and business users.

Use explainX to understand overall model behavior, explain the "why" behind model predictions, remove biases and create convincing explanations for your business stakeholders.

#### Why we need model explainability & interpretibility?

Essential for:
1. Explaining model predictions
2. Debugging models
3. Detecting biases in data
4. Gaining trust of business users
5. Successfully deploying AI solution

#### What questions can we answer with explainX?

1. Why did my model make a mistake? 
2. Is my model biased? If yes, where?
3. How can I understand and trust the model's decisions?
4. Does my model satisfy legal & regulatory requirements?

#### We have deployed the app on our server so you can play around with the dashboard. Check it out:

# Getting Started

## Installation

Python 3.5+ | Linux, Mac, Windows

```sh
pip install explainx
```

To download on Windows, please install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) first and then install the explainX package via ``` pip ```

## Installation on the cloud
If you are using a notebook instance on the cloud (AWS SageMaker, Colab, Azure), please follow our step-by-step guide to install & run explainX cloud. 
[Cloud Installation Instructions](https://docs.explainx.ai/getting-started/installation)


## Usage (Example)
After successfully installing explainX, open up your Python IDE of Jupyter Notebook and simply follow the code below to use it:

1. Import required module.

```python

from explainx import * 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

```

2. Load and split your dataset into x_data and y_data

```python

#Load Dataset: X_Data, Y_Data 
#X_Data = Pandas DataFrame
#Y_Data = Numpy Array or List

X_data,Y_data = explainx.dataset_heloc()

```

3. Split dataset into training & testing. 

``` python

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_data,Y_data, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)

```

4. Train your model.

```python

# Train a RandomForest Model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

```

After you're done training the model, you can either access the complete explainability dashboard or access individual techniques.


## Complete Explainability Dashboard

To access the entire dashboard with all the explainability techniques under one roof, follow the code down below. It is great for sharing your work with your peers and managers in an interactive and easy to understand way. 

5.1. Pass your model and dataset into the explainX function:

```python
explainx.ai(X_test, Y_test, model, model_name="randomforest")
```

5.2. Click on the dashboard link to start exploring model behavior:

```python

App running on https://127.0.0.1:8080

```


## Explainability Modules

In this latest release, we have also given the option to use explainability techniques individually. This will allow the user to choose technique that fits their personal AI use case. 

6.1. Pass your model, X_Data and Y_Data into the explainx_modules function. 

```python

explainx_modules.ai(model, X_test, Y_test)

```
As an upgrade, we have eliminated the need to pass in the model name as explainX is smart enough to identify the model type and problem type i.e. classification or regression, by itself. 

You can access multiple modules:

Module 1: Dataframe with Predictions
```python

explainx_modules.dataframe_graphing()

```

Module 2: Model Metrics
```python

explainx_modules.metrics()

```

Module 3: Global Level SHAP Values
```python

explainx_modules.shap_df()

```

Module 4: What-If Scenario Analysis (Local Level Explanations)
```python

explainx_modules.what_if_analysis()

```

Module 5: Partial Dependence Plot & Summary Plot
```python

explainx_modules.feature_interactions()

```

Module 6: Model Performance Comparison (Cohort Analysis)
```python

explainx_modules.cohort_analysis()

```

To access the modules within your jupyter notebook as IFrames, just pass the <b>mode='inline'</b> argument. 


<b>For detailed description into each module, check out our documentation at https://www.docs.explainx.ai</b>


## Cloud Installation

**If you are running explainX on the cloud e.g., AWS Sagemaker?** **https://0.0.0.0:8080** will not work.
Please visit our documentation for installation instructions for the cloud: [Cloud Installation Instructions](https://docs.explainx.ai/getting-started/installation)

After installation is complete, just open your **terminal** and run the following command.
```jupyter

lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p [port number]

```
```jupyter

lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p 8080

```
